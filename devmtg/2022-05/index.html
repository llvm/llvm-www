<p>What can you can expect at an LLVM Developers' Meeting?
<dl>

<br></dd>

<dt><b>Tutorials</b></dt>
<dd>Tutorials are 45-50 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and explanations.</dd>

<dt><b>Lightning Talks</b></dt>
<dd>These are fast 5 minute talks that give you a taste of a project or topic. Attendees will hear a wide range of topics and probably leave wanting to learn more.</dd>

<dt><b>Quick Talks</b></dt>
<dd>Quick 10 minute talks that dive a bit deeper into a topic, but not as deep as a Technical Talk.</dd>

<dt><b>Student Technical Talks</b></dt>
<dd>Graduate or Undergraduate students present their work using LLVM.</dd>

<dt><b>Panels</b></dt>
<dd>Panel sessions are guided discussions about a specific topic. The panel consists of ~3 developers who discuss a topic through prepared questions from a moderator. The audience is also given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.
</dd>

</dl>

</p>

<p>What types of people attend?
<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella

<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Students and Researchers</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for Papers</div>

All developers and users of LLVM and related sub-projects are invited to present at the 2022 EuroLLVM Developers’ Meeting! 
<br>
Submit your talk proposals here: <a href="https://hotcrp.llvm.org/eurollvm2022/">2022 EuroLLVM Talk Submissions</a><br>
</p>

<p>
Given the tight timeline and uncertainty of how many submissions we will have, we will be doing rolling reviews throughout the submission period. Please freeze your submission as soon as possible, so the program committee can provide feedback. There will be a short window of time after the submission deadline for final feedback before proposals are selected by the conference organizer. This is different than past conferences and program committees have been operated.
</p>

<p>
We are looking for the following proposals:
<ul>
<li>Technical Talks (20 minutes): Talks on: LLVM Infrastructure,Clang and all related sub-projects, On uses of LLVM in academia or industry, On new projects using Clang or LLVM</li>

<li>Tutorials (40-50 minutes*): In depth talks on LLVM infrastructure or other core libraries, tools, etc. Demos encouraged.</li>

<li>Student Technical Talks (15 minutes): Talks from students using LLVM, Clang, and all sub-projects in research. This is not a competition, but a specific category for student talks.
</li>

<li>Quick Technical Talks (10 minutes): Quick talks about a use or improvement of LLVM and other sub-projects.</li>

<li>Lightning Talks (5 minutes): Lightning fast talks about a use or improvement of LLVM and other sub-projects.</li>

<li>Panels (45 minutes*): Panels may discuss any topic as long as it’s relevant to LLVM or related sub-projects. Panels can take many forms, but a common format is to begin with short introductions from each panel member, and follow with an interactive dialogue among the panelists and audience members. Panels should consist of at least 3 people and have a moderator.
</li>

<li>Poster: Present a poster during the assigned poster session during the event.</li>
</ul>
</p>

* Exact times TBD after talks selected and the schedule planned
</p>
<p>
Submissions should be sent by April 1, 2022 at 11:59PM PDT.<br>

</p>
<p>
Please note that preference will be given to speakers who can present in person. Once we see how many submissions and in-person speakers we have, we will determine if we will allow remote speakers at all. Please indicate in your submission if you plan to present in person.

<ul>
<li>Talk title</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Submission type</li>
