    <li> <b>Krzysztof Parzyszek</b>: Register Data Flow framework
      <p>
        Register Data Flow is a framework implemented in LLVM that enables
        data-flow optimizations on machine IR after register allocation. While
        most of the data-flow optimizations on machine IR take place during the
        SSA phase, when virtual registers obey the static single assignment
        form, passes like pseudo-instruction expansion or frame index
        replacement may expose opportunities for further optimizations. At the
        same time, data-flow analysis is much more complicated after register
        allocation, and implementing compiler passes that require it may not
        seem like a worthwhile investment. The intent of RDF is to abstract this
        analysis and provide access to it through a familiar and convenient
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The central concept in RDF is a data-flow graph, which emulates SSA. In
        contrast to the SSA-based optimization phase where SSA is a part of the
        program representation, the RDF data-flow graph is a separate, auxiliary
        structure. It can be built on demand and it does not require any
        modifications to the program. Traversal of the graph can provide
        information about reaching definitions of any given register access, as
        well as reached definitions and reached uses for register
        definitions. The graph provides connections for easily locating the
        corresponding elements of the machine IR. A utility class that
        recalculates basic block live-in information is implemented to make
        writing whole-function optimizations easier. In this talk, I will give
        an overview of RDF and its use in the Hexagon backend.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Tao Schardl and William Moses</b>: The Tapir Extension to LLVM's Intermediate Representation for Fork-Join Parallelism
      <p>
        This talk explores how fork-join parallelism, as supported by
        dynamic-multithreading concurrency platforms such as Cilk and
        OpenMP, can be embedded into a compiler's intermediate
        representation (IR). Mainstream compilers typically treat parallel
        linguistic constructs as syntactic sugar for function calls into a
        parallel runtime. These calls prevent the compiler from performing
        optimizations across parallel control flow. Remedying this
        situation, however, is generally thought to require an extensive
        reworking of compiler analyses and code transformations to handle
        parallel semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tapir is a compiler IR that represents logically parallel tasks
        asymmetrically in the program's control flow graph. Tapir allows
        the compiler to optimize across parallel control flow with only
        minor changes to its existing analyses and code transformations. To
        prototype Tapir in the LLVM compiler, for example, we added or
        modified approximately 5000 lines of LLVM's approximately
        3-million-line codebase. Tapir enables many traditional compiler
        optimizations for serial code, including loop-invariant-code motion,
        common-subexpression elimination, and tail-recursion elimination, to
        optimize across parallel control flow, as well as purely parallel
        optimizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work was conducted in collaboration with Charles E. Leiserson.
        The proposal is a preliminary copy of our paper on Tapir, which will
        appear at PPoPP 2017. This talk will focus on the technical details
        of implementing Tapir in LLVM.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Aditya Kumar, Sebastian Pop, and Laxman Sole</b>: Performance analysis of libcxx
      <p>
        We will discuss the improvements and future work on libcxx. This
        includes the improvements on standard library algorithms like
        string::find and basic_streambuf::xsgetn. These algorithms were
        suboptimal and we got huge improvements after optimizing
        them. Similarly, we enabled the inlining of constructor and destructor
        of std::string. We will present a systematic analysis of function
        attributes in libc++ and the places where we added missing
        attributes. We will present a comparative analysis of clang-libc++
        vs. gcc-libstdc++ on representative benchmarks. Finally we will talk
        about our contributions to google-benchmark, which comes with libc++, to
        help keep track of performance regressions.
      </p>      
    </li>
    <li> <b>Hal Finkel</b>: Modeling restrict-qualified pointers in LLVM
      <p>
        It is not always possible for a compiler to statically determine enough
        about the pointer-aliasing properties of a program, especially for
        functions which need to be considered in isolation, to generate the
        highest-performance code possible. Multiversioning can be employed but
        its effectiveness is limited by the combinatorially-large number of
        potential configurations. To address these practical problems, the C
        standard introduced the restrict keyword which can adorn pointer
        variables. The restrict keyword can be used by the programmer to convey
        pointer-aliasing information to the optimizer. Often, this is
        information that is difficult or impossible for the optimizer to deduce
        on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The semantics of restrict, however, are subtle and rely on source-level
        constructs that are not generally represented within LLVM's
        IR. Maximally maintaining the aliasing information correctly in the face
        of function inlining and other code-motion transformations, without
        interfering with those transformations, is not trivial. While LLVM has
        long used strict-qualified pointers that are function arguments, and an
        initial phase of this work provided a way to preserve this information
        in the face of function inlining, I'll describe a new scheme in LLVM
        that allows the representation of aliasing information from block-local
        restrict-qualified pointers as well. This more-general class of
        restrict-qualified pointers is widely used in scientific code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this talk, I'll cover the use cases for restrict-qualified pointers,
        the difficulties in representing their semantics at the IR level, why
        the existing aliasing metadata cannot represent restrict-qualified
        pointers effectively, how the proposed representation allows the
        preservation of these semantics with minimal impact to the optimizer,
        and how the optimizer can use this information to generate
        higher-performance code. I'll also discuss how this scheme relates to
        others related to pointer variables (e.g. TBAA and alignment
        assumptions).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Mehdi Amini</b>: LTO/ThinLTO Bof
      <p>
        LTO is an important techniques for getting the maximum performance from
        the compiler. We presented the ThinLTO model and implementation in LLVM
        at the last LLVM Dev Meeting. This provided the audience with a good
        overview of the high-level flow of ThinLTO and the 3-phases split
        involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposal for this BoF is to gather and discuss the existing
        user-experience, the current limitations and what features folks are
        expecting the most out of ThinLTO. We can go over the current
        optimizations currently in development upstream.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Johannes Doerfert</b>: Polyhedral "Driven" Optimizations on Real Codes
      <p>In this talk I will present polyhedral "driven" optimizations on real
        codes.  The term polyhedral "driven" is used as there are two flavors of
        optimization I want to discuss (depending on my progress and the
        duration of the talk).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first follows the classical approach applied by LLVM/Polly but with
        special consideration of general benchmarks like SPEC. I will show how
        LLVM/Polly can be used to perform beneficial optimizations in (at least)
        libquantum, hmmer, lbm and bzip2. I will also discuss what I think is
        needed to identify such optimization opportunities automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second polyhedral driven optimization I want to present is a
        conceptual follow-up of the "Polyhedral Info" GSoC project. This project
        was the first try to augment LLVM analysis and transformation passes
        with polyhedral information.  While the project was build on top of
        LLVM/Polly, I will present an alternative approach. First I will
        introduce a modular, demand driven and caching polyhedral program
        analysis that natively integrates into the existing LLVM pipeline. Then
        I will show how to utilize this analysis in existing LLVM optimizations
        to improve performance. Finally, I will use the polyhedral analysis to
        derive new, complex control flow optimizations that are not, or only in
        a simpler form, present in LLVM.
      </p>

    <li> <b>Tobias Grosser</b>: Polly-ACC - Accelerator support with Polly-ACC
      <p>
        Programming today's increasingly complex heterogeneous hardware is
        difficult, as it commonly requires the use of data-parallel languages,
        pragma annotations, specialized libraries, or DSL compilers. Adding
        explicit accelerator support into a larger code base is not only costly,
        but also introduces additional complexity that hinders long-term
        maintenance. We propose a new heterogeneous compiler that brings us
        closer to the dream of automatic accelerator mapping. Starting from a
        sequential compiler IR, we automatically generate a hybrid executable
        that - in combination with a new data management system - transparently
        offloads suitable code regions. Our approach is almost regression free
        for a wide range of applications while improving a range of compute
        kernels as well as two full SPEC CPU applications. We expect our work to
        reduce the initial cost of accelerator usage and to free developer time
        to investigate algorithmic changes.

    </li>
    <li> <b>Brian Railing</b>: Improving LLVM Instrumentation Overheads
      <p>
        The behavior and structure of a shared-memory parallel program can be
        characterized by a task graph that encodes the instructions, memory
        accesses, and dependencies of each piece of parallel work. The task
        graph representation can encode the actions of any threading library and
        is agnostic to the target architecture. Contech [1] is an LLVM-based
        tool that generates a task graph representation, by instrumenting the
        program when it is compiled such that it ultimately outputs a task graph
        when executed. This paper describes several approaches to improving the
        overhead of Contech's instrumentation by augmenting the static compiler
        analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The additional analyses are able to first determine similar memory
        address calculations in the LLVM intermediate representation and elide
        them from the instrumentation to reduce the data recorded, an approach
        only previously attempted with dynamic binary instrumentation based on
        common registers [2] [3]. Second, this analysis is supplemented by
        performing tail duplication which increases the memory operations in a
        single basic block and therefore may provide further opportunities to
        elide instrumentation, without compromising the accuracy or detail of
        the data recorded. These optimizations reduce the data recorded by 22%,
        which has a proportionate decrease in overhead from 3.7x to 3.3x for
        PARSEC benchmarks.

    <li> <b>Evandro Menezes, Sebastian Pop, and Aditya Kumar</b>: Efficient clustering of case statements for indirect branch predictors
      <p>
        We present an O(nlogn) algorithm as implemented in LLVM to compile a
        switch statement into jump tables. To generate jump tables that can be
        efficiently predicted by current hardware branch predictors, we added an
        upper bound on the number of entries in each generated jump table. This
        modification of the previously best known algorithm reduces the
        complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlogn).  We illustrate the performance
        achieved by the improved algorithm on the Samsung Exynos-M1 processor
        running several benchmarks.

    <li> <b>Pranav Bhandarkar, Anshuman Dasgupta, Ron Lieberman, Dan Palermo, Dillon Sharlet, and Andrew Adams</b>: Halide for Hexagon™ DSP with Hexagon Vector eXtensions (HVX) using LLVM
      <p>
        Halide is a domain specific language that endeavors to make it easier to
        construct large and composite image processing applications. Halide is
        unique in its design approach to decoupling the algorithm from the
        organization (schedule) of the computation. Algorithms once written and
        tested for correctness can then be continually tuned for performance as
        Halide allows for easily changing the schedule - tiling, parallelizing,
        prefetching or vectorizing different dimensions of the loop nest that
        form the structure of the algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Halide programs are transformed into the Halide Intermediate
        Representation (IR) by the Halide compiler. This IR is analyzed and
        optimized before generating LLVM bitcode for the target
        requested. Halide links with the LLVM optimizer and codegen libraries
        for supported targets, and uses these to generate object code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this workshop, we will present our work on retargeting Halide to the
        Hexagon™ DSP with focus on the Hexagon™ Vector eXtensions (HVX).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our workshop will present the halide constructs used in a simple blur
        5x5, the corresponding Halide IR, and a few of the important LLVM
        Hexagon passes which generate HVX vector instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will demonstrate compilation using LLVM.org and Halide.org tools, and
        execution of the blur 5x5 pipeline on a Snapdragon 820 development board
        using the Halide Hexagon offloader. In particular we will demonstrate
        the various improvements which can be realized with scheduling changes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Sergei Larin and Harsha Jagasia</b>: Impact of the current LLVM inlining strategy on complex embedded application memory utilization and performance
      <p>
        Sophisticated embedded applications with extensive and fine degree of
        memory management are presenting a unique challenge to contemporary tool
        chains. Like many open source projects LLVM optimizes its core
        optimization tradeoffs for common cases and a set of common
        architectures. Even with back end specific hooks, it is not always
        possible to exert appropriate degree of control over some key
        optimizations. We propose a case study on "in-depth" analysis of LLVM
        PGO assisted inlining in a complex embedded application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program in question is a large scale embedded networking application
        designed to be custom tuned for a variety of actual embedded platforms
        with a range of memory and performance constrains. It makes a high use
        of linker scripts to configure and fine tune memory assignment to
        ultimately guarantee optimal performance in constrained memory
        environment while being extremely power conscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment a tool chain is addressing a non-uniform memory model, "one
        size fits all" approach to optimizations like inlining stops being
        optimal. For instance, based on section assignment, completely unknown
        to the compiler, inlining takes place in areas that are facing different
        cost/benefit tradeoffs. The content of L1 and L2 Icache should not be
        "enlarged" even if performance can theoretically improve. Inlining
        across such section boundaries are also ill-advisable, since control
        flow exchange (jump) between sections destined to different levels of
        memory hierarchy can produce unexpected performance
        implications. Finally, tightly budgeted low-level and high-performance
        memories might swell beyond their physical limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current state of LLVM inline is somewhat transitional in
        anticipation of structural updates to the pass manager, and as such it
        still strongly relies on heuristic + PGO based inline cost
        computation. In such situation the introduction of back-end hooks might
        allow targets to fine-tune inlining decisions to some degree but they
        still fall far short to the degree of control needed by the
        above-described systems. Additional challenge is posed by high degree of
        complexity to capture actual system run-time behavior, and even
        collecting appropriate traces to generate meaningful PGO data. Battery
        powered embedded chips rarely have sophisticated tracing capabilities,
        yet present extremely complex run time environments.
