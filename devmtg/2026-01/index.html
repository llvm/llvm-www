<div class="www_sectiontitle">Call for Speakers</div>
<p>
  We invite speakers from academia and industry to present their work on the following list of topics (including and not
  limited to:)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improving performance and code-size of applications built by LLVM toolchains</li>
  <li>Improving performance of LLVM's runtime libraries</li>
  <li>Improving the security of generated code</li>
  <li>Any tools or products developed by using one of the libraries in LLVM infrastructure</li>
  <li>Performance tracking over time</li>
  <li>Compiler flags, annotations and remarks to understand and improve performance</li>
  <li>Any other topic related to improving and maintaining the performance and quality of LLVM generated code</li>
</ul>
<p>

  While the primary focus of the workshop is on these topics, we welcome
  any submission related to the LLVM-project, its sub-projects (clang,
  mlir, lldb, Polly, lld, openmp, pstl, compiler-rt, etc.), as well as
  their use in industry and academia.
</p>

<p>We are looking for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keynote speakers (30-60minutes),</li>
  <li>technical presentations (25 minutes plus questions and discussion),</li>
  <li>tutorials (30-60minutes),</li>
  <li>BOFs (30-60minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Proposals should provide sufficient information for the review
  committee to be able to judge the quality of the submission. Proposals
  can be submitted under the form of an extended abstract, full paper,
  or slides. Accepted presentations can be presented in-person or online. The presentations will be publicly available on
  <a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/">https://llvm.org/devmtg/</a>, and recordings will be available on LLVM's YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2_41bSAa5Y_8BacJUZfjQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2_41bSAa5Y_8BacJUZfjQ</a>)

  In case of any queries please reach out to the workshop organizers: Aditya
  (hiraditya at msn.com), Jose M Monsalve Diaz (josem.monsalvediaz at amd.com),
  Shilei Tian (i at tianshilei.me), Rafael Andres Herrera Guaitero (rafaelhg at udel.edu), or Kevin Sala (salapenades1 at llnl.gov).
</p>

<h4>What types of people attend?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld,
    OpenMP, MLIR, etc).</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
  <li>Students and Researchers.</li>
  <li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
  <li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Birds of a Feather (BoF)</h4>
A BoF session, an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and
carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.

<h4>Technical Talks</h4>
These 25 minute talks cover all topics from core infrastructure talks, to project's using LLVM's infrastructure.
Attendees will take away technical information that could be pertinent to their project or general interest.

<h4>Tutorials</h4>
Tutorials are 30-60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and
explanations.
