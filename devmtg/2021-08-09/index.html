<div class="www_sectiontitle">The First Workshop on LLVM in Parallel Processing (LLPP) will be held at ICPP 2021</div>

<p>
  The LLVM framework is a vast ecosystem that stretches far beyond a "simple"
  C/C++ compiler. The variety of programming-language and toolchain-related
  parts includes the components to support a host of parallel programming
  models and libraries, including CUDA, HIP, OpenMP, SYCL, and the C++ parallel
  algorithms. In addition, LLVM serves as a vehicle for various languages in
  which parallelism is a first class citizen, such as Julia or Chapel.

  The workshop is held in conjunction with the ICPP during the workshop day.

  If you are interested in attending the workshop, please register at the
  <a href="https://oaciss.uoregon.edu/icpp21/index.php">ICPP website.</a>

  Note: It has not yet been decided if the workshop will be held in person or
  virtual, please see the ICPP website for more information. Depending on the
  decision for the conference we will try to accomodate all interested parties.

<b>Workshop</b></br>
LLVM is an award-winning compiler infrastructure used in industry
and academia for creating novel optimizing compilers, program
analysis tools, and new programming languages. The goal of LLPP
is to bring together researchers and practitioners that use LLVM
for parallel processing, including but not limited on the topics
of parallelism-aware compilation and optimization, parallelism-
specific program analysis, and new parallel programming models
and implementations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Topics of Interest</b></br>
Focus areas LLPP include but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>Parallelism-aware compilation and optimization
        <ul>
            <li>Parallelism analysis in compilation</li>
            <li>Parallelism-aware compiler optimizations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Parallel programming languages and models
        <ul>
            <li>Domain-specific parallel programming languages</li>
            <li>Novel parallelism models and implementations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Performance analysis and tuning in LLVM
        <ul>
            <li>Performance analysis tools for parallelism</li>

Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS), in conjunction with
those of other ICPP workshops, in a volume entitled 50th
International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops
(ICPP 2021 Workshops). This volume will be available for
download via the ACM Digital Library.
