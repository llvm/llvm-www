<p>
The LLVM Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose mission is to support education and advancement of the field of compilers and tools through educational events, grants and scholarships, and increasing diversity with the field of compilers, tools, and the LLVM project. We have established 3 main programs: Educational Outreach, Grants & Scholarships, and Women in Compilers & Tools.</p>

<p>The Educational Outreach program is our largest program and includes educational materials and events related to the LLVM Project, compiler technology, and tools. Our 2 largest events are the LLVM Developers’ meetings located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in Europe. These meetings serve as a forum for LLVM project developers, users, and academic researchers to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and compiler technology. This program also includes educational materials such as instructional videos and full video recordings from our developer meetings that are available free to anyone.</p>

<p>The LLVM project is becoming one of the top platforms of choice for compiler research at universities. The Grants & Scholarships program is designed to support student presenter travel to the LLVM Developers’ Meetings and other conferences that students may attend and present their LLVM and compiler related work.</p>

<p>Lastly, our Women in Compilers & Tools program aims to increase female participation in the LLVM Project and the field of compilers and tools. We hope to achieve this by increasing awareness of the LLVM project at various technical conferences with strong female participation, established a mentor program, and lower barriers of entry for this field.</p>
